# Project Report: Smart To-Do List Application

## 1. Project Overview
**Title**: Smart To-Do List with Priority & Persistence  
**Language**: Python 3  
**Type**: Command-Line Application  
**Duration**: 1 Day  
**Author**: [Your Name]

## 2. Objectives
- Build a functional task manager
- Learn file I/O with JSON
- Implement clean OOP design
- Practice user input validation

## 3. Features Implemented
- Task creation with title, priority, due date, category
- View all tasks with visual status
- Mark tasks as complete
- Edit and delete tasks
- Auto-save/load using JSON

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Add reminders with notifications
- Search and filter tasks
- Add tags and subtasks
- Web version using Flask/FastAPI

**Conclusion**: This project is a solid foundation for a personal productivity tool and demonstrates core Python concepts effectively.
